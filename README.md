# namaste - The nowaste App

A collaborative project for a better environment, lesser climatic catastrophes and the holistic development of the society

## Short Description

### What's the problem

Millions of tons of waste is being produced on this planet every single day.Waste can be primarily classified into Bio-waste, Agricultural waste, E-waste and Plastic waste. The efficiency of the waste disposal prevailing in most countries is questionable and differs negligibly from one kind of waste to another. Consequently, it does not come as a surprise that these disposal methods affect the environment and the climate of the Earth adversely. Burning plastic, rotting biowaste, neglected electronic waste - all of them contribute to serious factors of climatic change like global warming. A proper network and method of disposal is the need of the hour and any instance of neglect would lead to irrepairable damage to our planet.

### How can technology help?

Given the advancements in the field of technology, waste disposal has to be made effective using the networking capability it gives to users as well as practicing radically different waste management methods which utilises every aspect of technology ranging from a simple mobile app to artificial intelligence and machine learning.

### The idea

The idea here is to introduce people to new ways of waste disposal through an easy to use mobile app backed by IBM services like IBM Cloud, IBM Authentication, IBM Visual Recognition as well as Watson Services. The aim is to start a community for proper collection and relaying of waste from individual households, managing and disposing them off via methods beneficial to the environment and the society as a whole.

### What is this project?

The project consists of several sections for managing waste efficiently.

## **Disposing waste**

The project focuses on collecting and disposing primarily 4 types of waste:

**BIO WASTE** : The biological waste collected by the community will be taken to black soldier fly farms where these flies decompose the organic matter without as much as a scratch to the environment. The black soldier fly is an insect known for its ability in decomposing of organic matter. The black soldier fly larva (BSFL) can convert manure and organic feed into nutritional meal for animals. While decomposition of the organic matter can be achieved, mass production of the BSFL can also be achieved since a single female fly can produce upto 500 eggs. The larvae known to be extremely rich in protein can be successfully used as a substitute for animal feed at prices as low as half of the cost of currently available feed. The quantity of feed needed would also drastically reduce since 5g of BSFL would compensate 10g of the ordinary food feed. The black soldier flies are found in climates similar to that found in Kerala, but are not found in any of the neighbouring states. This implies, decomposition of waste in BSF farms would mean not only ensure economical stability, but economic growth without compromising the effectiveness of the waste disposal method.

**PLASTIC WASTE** : The bulk of plastic waste collected would be used in producing commodities that are useful for the society. However, care has to be taken to not use recycled plastic for any goods that comes in close contact with people or animals. Hence, we came up with the idea of flower pots made of recycled plastic. These would be useful compared to the mudpots in the sense thatplastic pots would be more durable and manageable. They will not be brittle in contrast to their mud counterparts. Our aim is to avoid incineration of plastias it is undoubtedly disastrous for the environment.

**AGRICULTURAL WASTE**
